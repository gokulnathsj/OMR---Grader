# OMR---Grader


This is a sample OMR - grader made with the help of image processing(OPENCV) which will show the correct answer along with the final grades. I have done the result testing for a sample of 5 questions where every ansers are bubbled. 
The program will print the result in a separate image where the correct answers will be marked with green circles and wrong ones with red 
cirlces. It will also predict the test scores. I have'nt included the case for multiple correct answers and the left out questions.
